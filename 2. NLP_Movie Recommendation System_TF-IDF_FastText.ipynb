Based on the original paper titled ‘Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information’ by Mikolov et al. which is an excellent read to gain an in-depth understanding of how this model works. Overall, FastText is a framework for learning word representations and also performing robust, fast and accurate text classification. The framework is open-sourced by Facebook on GitHub and claims to have the following.FastText 是一个用于学习单词表示并执行稳健、快速且准确的文本分类的框架。该框架由 Facebook 在 GitHub 上开源，并声称具有以下功能\n",

        "In general, predictive models like the Word2Vec model typically considers each word as a distinct entity (e.g. `where`) and generates a dense embedding for the word. However this poses to be a serious limitation with languages having massive vocabularies and many rare words which may not occur a lot in different corpora. The Word2Vec model typically ignores the morphological structure of each word and considers a word as a single entity. The FastText model considers each word as a Bag of Character n-grams. This is also called as a subword model in the paper. 一般来说，像 Word2Vec 模型这样的预测模型通常将每个单词视为不同的实体（例如“where”）并为该单词生成密集嵌入。然而，对于拥有大量词汇和许多生僻字的语言来说，这构成了严重的限制，而这些生僻字在不同的语料库中可能不会经常出现。 Word2Vec 模型通常会忽略每个单词的形态结构，并将单词视为单个实体。 FastText 模型将每个单词视为字符 n 元语法包。在本文中这也被称为子词模型。\n",
        "\n",
        "We add special boundary symbols < and > at the beginning and end of words. This enables us to distinguish prefixes and suffixes from other character sequences. We also include the word w itself in the set of its n-grams, to learn a representation for each word (in addition to its character n-grams). Taking the word `where` and n=3 (tri-grams) as an example, it will be represented by the character n-grams: `<wh, whe, her, ere, re>` and the special sequence `<where>` representing the whole word. Note that the sequence , corresponding to the word `<her>` is different from the tri-gram `her` from the word `where`.\n",
        "我们在单词的开头和结尾添加特殊的边界符号<and>。这使我们能够将前缀和后缀与其他字符序列区分开来。我们还将单词 w 本身包含在其 n 元语法集中，以学习每个单词的表示（除了其字符 n 元语法之外）。以单词“where”和 n=3（三元组）为例，它将由字符 n 元组表示：“<wh, whe, her, ere, re>”和特殊序列“<where” >` 代表整个单词。请注意，对应于单词“<her>”的序列 与单词“where”的三元组“her”不同。\n",
