# Project: Language Detector

## Introduction

Language detection is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying the language of a given text. This project aims to build a language detection model capable of recognizing multiple languages based on text input. 

This project first preprocesses the dataset: converting the text into numerical representations using techniques like Bag-of-words, and TF-IDF vectorization. Then I train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, a widely used algorithm for text classification tasks, to  predict the language of the test dataset. The model is evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score, etc. to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.

This project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP techniques can be applied to solve real-world problems in multilingual environments, showcasing the power of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification models.
