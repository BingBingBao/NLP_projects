# 📂 Project Overview

## 1. Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

📌 Objective: Classify movie reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

🔹 Models Used
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Leverages convolutional filters to capture local patterns in text.
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – Designed for sequential data processing:
  - GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) – Efficiently captures sequential dependencies with fewer parameters.
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – Captures long-term dependencies in text sequences.
  - Stacked LSTM – A multi-layered LSTM model for learning hierarchical representations.

## 2. Movie Recommendation System using Document Similarity

📌 Objective: Build a content-based movie recommendation system by analyzing movie descriptions and finding similar movies using text similarity techniques.

🔹 Methods Used:
  - TF-IDF for text vectorization.
  - Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between movie descriptions.
  - Pairwise Document Similarity for recommendation generation.

✔️ Outcome: A content-based recommender system that suggests similar movies based on textual similarity.
