# 📚 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects Repository 🗣️

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects Repository! This collection includes various NLP techniques, focusing on text preprocessing, document similarity, embeddings, and recommendation systems. Each project is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, covering data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

📌 Key Features

✔️ Covers both traditional NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity) and modern deep learning-based methods (Word Embeddings, FastText).

✔️ Uses real-world text datasets to build document similarity models.

✔️ Implements text feature engineering, similarity computation, and NLP-based recommendation systems.

✔️ FastText embeddings applied for better semantic understanding.

# 📂 Project Overview

## 1. Movie Recommendation System using Document Similarity 

📌 Objective: Build a content-based movie recommendation system by analyzing movie descriptions and finding similar movies using text similarity techniques.

🔹 Methods Used:
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.
  - Cosine Similarity to compute document similarity.
  - Pairwise Document Similarity for movie recommendations.

✔️ Outcome: A content-based recommender that suggests similar movies based on descriptions.
